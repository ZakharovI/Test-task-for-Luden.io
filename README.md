# Hello!

This project took ~12 hours to prepare and build from scratch.

Before this project I didnâ€™t know anything about Lua and Defold, so I learned a lot from tutorials on the Defold official website and different forums. It is always very interesting when you start working in a new engine (and also with new program language). Thanks Luden.io for such awesome experience.

Wish you a good game!
